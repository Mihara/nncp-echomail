# Extras: Lagrange userscripts

This is an example userscript for [Lagrange](https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/) that intercepts your gemini files containing Echomail headers and re-renders them into a prettier form, while also converting UTC datetimes to a local timezone. Look for `mimehooks.txt` in Largange documentation to see how to enable userscripts.

Getting from this to a script that inserts a "Reply" link pointing to a locally running TITAN server where the text you enter will be packaged into an envelope and sent is left as an exercise for the reader.
